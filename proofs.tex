\section{Binary bijection}\label{proof:binary_bijection}

Claim: For every $n \in \setN$

\[[b] = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^i \cdot b_i \]

is a bijection from $\setB^n$ to $\setN_{<2^ n}$

Proof by induction on $n \in \setN$.

Base case: Let $n = 0$. Then:

\[ \setB^n = 	\{ \epsilon \}\]

and	

\[  [\epsilon] = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{-1} 2^i \cdot \epsilon_i = 0 < 1 = 2^n\]

Induction step: Let $[.]$ be a bijection to $\setN_{<2^ n}$ for an arbitrary but fixed $n \in \setN$.

Then every element $b \in \setB^{n+1}$ is displayable as

\[b = r \circ a \]

where $a \in \setB$ and $r \in \setB^n$, so that

\[[b] := \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n} 2^i \cdot b_i  = \left(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^i \cdot b_i\right) + 2^n \cdot a\]

If $a = 0$ then

\[[b] = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^i \cdot b_i = [r]\]

So, according to the induction hypothesis, by adjusting $r$ we can hit each element of $\setN_{<2^n}$ exactly once and no image can be outside this set.

If $a = 1$ then

\[[b] = \left(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^i \cdot b_i\right) + 2^n = [r] + 2^n\]

So, according to the induction hypothesis, by adjusting $r$ we can hit each element of $\{n \in \setN \mid 2^n \leq n < 2^{n+1}\}$ exactly once and no image can be outside this set.

This shows that by applying $[.]$ to every element of $\setB^{n+1}$ we hit every element of $\setN_{<2^{n+1}}$ exactly once and never hit a natural number outside this set.
